GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE HTTP verbs are supported. 

You can add new album by making a POST request to /album/,
modify an existing resource (please add a new resource before PUTing or DELETEing because the top three resources are ready-only)

The main code is contained in the "backend" and "frontend" directories, the rest can be ignored as they have been cloned from the https://github.com/ketansrivastav/create-mern repoto scaffold a basic MERN setup.
